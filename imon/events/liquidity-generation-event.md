## Liquidity Generation Event (LGE) <a href="#36c5" id="36c5"></a>

A Liquidity Generation Event (LGE) is an innovative initial token distribution mechanism enabling a free and fair participation process with no pre-sales, private sales.

Liquidity Generation Event is a fair launch event designed to reward every participant equally. In this event, **IMON** (Intelligent Monsters) will utilize a smart contract that accepts only **MATIC**(Polygon), and users can contribute to the launch contract using the tokens.

After the completion of a 14 day deposit period, the MATIC collected will be paired with 90% of the supply of **IMON** tokens to create the first **IMON** pool.

**IMON DIAMOD Smart Contract** [0x6f027c2ee898c12f7a00e7ce5d06ed9f329e314e](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x6f027c2ee898c12f7a00e7ce5d06ed9f329e314e)

**IMON TOKEN Smart Contract** [0x9631be8566fC71d91970b10AcfdEe29F21Da6C27](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x9631be8566fC71d91970b10AcfdEe29F21Da6C27)

## How to Participate <a href="#03e4" id="03e4"></a>

Users can join the LGE pool with $MATIC(Polygon) coin. The total $MATIC coins collected in the pool till 03‚Äì07‚Äì2022 00:01:12 are divided by the price(0.0001 $MATIC), and the amount of $IMON tokens earned for each $MATIC coin is calculated and distributed to the users. The same amount of $IMON coins is added to the liquidity along with the $MATIC coins collected in the pool.

### Example: <a href="#2193" id="2193"></a>

User 1, join the LGE event with 1 $MATIC user 10000.0 $IMON earns;

$MATIC1/$0.0001= 10000.0 IMON tokens.

# üåà Introduction

## IMON Begins

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

Herbert Alexander Simon was an American political scientist, with a Ph.D. in political science, whose work also influenced the fields of computer science, economics, and cognitive psychology. His primary research interest was decision-making within organizations and he is best known for the theories of ‚Äúbounded rationality‚Äù and ‚Äúsatisficing‚Äù.He received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1978 and the Turing Award in computer science in 1975. His research was noted for its interdisciplinary nature and spanned across the fields of cognitive science, computer science, public administration, management, and political science. He was at Carnegie Mellon University for most of his career, from 1949 to 2001.

Notably, Simon was among the pioneers of several modern-day scientific domains such as artificial intelligence, information processing, decision-making, problem-solving, organization theory, and complex systems. He was among the earliest to analyze the architecture of complexity and to propose a preferential attachment mechanism to explain power law distributions.

Time proved him right, albeit late, and he was proved right after nearly 30 years. Today, artificial intelligence has become an indispensable part of technology. In order to give Simon his due, we take the name of our project from the name Simon and bring it to you as intelligent monsters, namely (S)I-mon.

## Blockchain & Artificial Intelligence

Blockchain‚Äôs evolution is already written in history and science. It will fuel a major change in human habits, a great clash of ideology and ultimately, become the way AI propagates on its own.

DNA is the chemical inside the nucleus of all cells within an organism that carries the exact genetic instructions to recreate it. It contains four different chemical bases ‚Äî represented by the letters A, T, C and G ‚Äî arranged in a double helix structure. The particular order of the four bases defines how an species should look like, and slight variations gives individuals their unique traits. Bigger gene mutations enable a species to adapt and survive to changing external conditions. Conceptually the blockchain isn‚Äôt very different. It uses crytopgraphy mathematics to parse information represented in 1‚Äôs and 0‚Äôs (binary code) into a long chain of records that keeps extending as new information is added. This chain propagates exact copies of itself throughout its network to ensure it is hard to lose or corrupt.

In its most basic sense, a blockchain is an ever-growing digital ledger that can store data. A blockchain is an articulated data structure called a block, arranged in chronological order, linked and secured by cryptographic proofs. Blockchain transactions occur within a peer-to-peer network of globally distributed computers (nodes). Each node maintains a copy of the blockchain and contributes to the functioning and security of the network. As a distributed ledger technology (DLT), blockchain is deliberately designed to be highly resistant to modification and fraud (such as double spending). This is true because, as a database of records, the Bitcoin blockchain is immutable and indestructible without an impractical amount of electricity and computational power, meaning that this network can implement the concept of ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù digital documents and create each and every one of them.

The blocks are permanently ‚Äòchained‚Äô together. In practice, the ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù is an immutable medium. It contains instructions in the form of computer code and is copied in thousands of nodes like DNA in cells. By the way, the word node means that many identical copies of a blockchain database reside in a large network of multiple computers, rather than a central administrator keeping a computer in one place. These computers; are nodes (Nodes). From this perspective, blockchains are very similar to cells containing many identical copies of DNA.

A blockchain responds to computations. It develops, adapts, self-regulates, and reproduces in a closed-circuit system like DNA. Therefore, Blockchain technology gains a feature that can meet a theoretical definition of life.

There are a number of functional and structural similarities between the blockchain and DNA, a self-replicating molecule that is the genetic blueprint for all known life. Are you ready for more? Blockchain system has possible advantages in the biological life cycle. A blockchain system can transfer data even more efficiently from biological lineages to new blocks (descendants). These inherited traits are developed to direct their evolution towards each other. Unlike our carbon-based biological lives, technological lifeforms could have a potentially indefinite lifespan in theory and perhaps in the future. Who knows? Self-regulating systems may be on their way to becoming indistinguishable from the biological life we ‚Äã‚Äãstudy every day. Artificial intelligence (AI), based on artificial neural networks, coordinates processes the same way a brain does. It is possible to transfer the experience and information gained by artificial intelligence with a cybernetic system with blocks in the digital DNA structure. In this sense, the emergence of blockchain as the new life building block of the modern world is not even sincere.

Computing systems share many similarities with biological life forms. Blockchain, in particular, exhibits some characteristics of life and can meet the definition of life, at least in theory. From a computational point of view, there are similarities between the ways DNA and genetics drive evolution and how blockchain nodes drive technological progress. I am not claiming that blockchains are actually alive like a biological cell. But the claim that a ‚Äúblockchain-based‚Äù organism ‚Äúfits some definition of life‚Äù and can surpass biological life in terms of evolutionary adaptation and development terrifies me as well. We argue that blockchain networks follow all widely accepted criteria for biological life, only without the biological part and eventually able to grow and develop just like an organism.

Wasn‚Äôt blockchain just for transactions and record keeping? Could it contain enough digital instructions to replicate an artificial intelligence, such as a replica of an entire living organism? When we combine the self-improvement capability of machine learning with the self-protection design of the blockchain, will we then create a digital version of the machine DNA using the blockchain to protect the AI‚Äôs we will trust to run our own work? Against the limited storage capability of DNA, does Blockchain‚Äôs ability to reach unlimited dimensions, the ability to transfer all acquired characteristics to its offspring (blocks), a programmed death scenario, or the ability to immortality reveal a new and superior DNA model?

These advantages could theoretically allow AI running on such a blockchain to evolve in a way that resembles the randomness of natural selection but with more aspects than it, resulting in the birth of artificial general intelligence that ultimately makes itself smarter.
